        <p>
            <em>ofNewLeaves()</em> is an installation relying on an autonomous generative system of
            drawing and animation of computational botanical shapes.
        </p>
        <p>
            As algorithmic seeds, little boxes of New Leaves are disseminated on the soil
            suggesting always new archetypical forms of life through the drawings of growing
            curves.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>ofNewLeaves()</em> is also a technical study representing the first step of the design of a
            system of drawing and animation ideated by experimenting the aesthetic possibilities of
            a combination of programming techniques and C++/openFrameworks features, such as
            Object-Oriented Programming, trigonometry, C++ data structures and Catmull-Rom
            splines (Catmull and Rom, 1974).
