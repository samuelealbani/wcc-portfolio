        <h1>Con-Touch</h1>
        <p>
            “Con-Touch” is a musical instrument to be played re-enacting the gesture of the
            handshake by two persons wearing interactive gloves ideated as a form of interaction
            for an installation, performed by the public. The instrument shows how a simple gesture
            could rearticulate performances that engage the intimacy of the body in relationship with
            social behaviours and technology. The sound and the elective context transform the
            simple gestures in an always different performative action, according to who is playing
            in that particular moment and the relationship or the differences and distances existing
            between them, such as generational, social, gender, etc. Con-Touch is a form of
            experimentation of the virtual realm that does not renounce physical contact, thus
            opening critical reflections within embodied and intimate haptic experiences of the
            boundaries between bodies, perspectives, and personalities.
        </p>
        <p>
            This instrument sets the base of a research that explores the use of the embodied
            experience as a lens for the contemporary social behaviours, creating performances of
            human-computer-human interactions, that make bodies resonate in a dialog of gestures
            of the social encounter.</p>
