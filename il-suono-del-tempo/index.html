        <h1>Il suono del tempo</h1>
        <p>
            Il suono del tempo (The sound of time) is a musical instrument that collects on the
            internet the historical meteorological information of the city of London, to be used as
            input for a data-driven sequencer that orchestrates visuals and sound. The instrument
            investigates the possibilities of the use of databases as musical notation, employing the
            atmospheric variations as criteria for compositional decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project is interdisciplinary as it intersects the fields of music, visual arts, and
            computing. It also relies on several fields of studies and programming techniques such
            as digital sound processing and synthesis, API management, logic, and Object-Oriented
            Programming.</p>
        <p>
            It consists of a sound art installation composed of speakers and an object equipped with
            a display that ironically simulates the household weather forecast station, showing the
            data variations as texts, colours, graphics, and particles.
